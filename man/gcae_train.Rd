\title{Train model, and save its state at certain epochs to disk.}
\usage{
gcae_train(
  gcae_setup,
  epochs = 1,
  save_interval = 1,
  gcae_options = create_gcae_options(),
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gcae_setup}{GCAE model setup,
as created by \link{create_gcae_setup},
read from file by \link{read_gcae_setup_file},
checked by \link{check_gcae_setup},
and saved to file by \link{save_gcae_setup}.}

\item{epochs}{number of epochs, as checked by \link{check_epochs}}

\item{save_interval}{epoch intervals at which to save state of model,
and at which to calculate the valid loss}

\item{gcae_options}{options to run GCAE,
as created by \link{create_gcae_options}}

\item{verbose}{the verbosity of a function.
Set to \link{TRUE} for more output.
Use \link[plinkr]{check_verbose} to detect if this argument is valid.}
}
\value{
full paths to the created files
}
\description{
Train model, and save its state at certain epochs to disk,
use the GCAE command-line interface.
}
\details{
This will train the model from epoch zero. To resume training,
use \link{gcae_train_more}
}
\examples{
if (plinkr::is_on_ci() && has_cloned_gcae_repo()) {
  gcae_options <- create_gcae_options()
  gcae_setup <- create_test_gcae_setup()
  train_filenames <- gcae_train(
    gcae_setup = gcae_setup,
    epochs = 1,
    save_interval = 1
  )
}
}
\seealso{
Use \link{gcae_train_more} to continue training.
Use \link{create_gcae_train_args} to get the command-line
arguments.
