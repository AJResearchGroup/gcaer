\arguments{
\item{args}{arguments for the \code{GCAE} executable}

\item{base_input_filename}{the base of the filenames that are
used as input for \code{GCAE}/\code{GCAE2}}

\item{base_output_filename}{the base of the filenames that are
used as output for \code{GCAE}/\code{GCAE2}}

\item{base_phenotype_value}{the base phenotypic value for an additive trait,
i.e. the phenotypic value for homozygotes of the common allele}

\item{confidence_interval}{confidence interval, a value between (and
excluding both) 0.0 and 1.0. The confidence interval helps assess
the certainty of an estimation: you can be 99 percent sure
a value is within the range of the 0.99 confidence interval}

\item{epistatic_phenotype_value}{the phenotypic value when the
epistatic phenotype is expressed}

\item{example_filename}{name of the example file}

\item{log_filename}{name of a \code{GCAE} \code{.log} file}

\item{maf}{minor allele frequency threshold.
Alleles that have a frequency lower than the MAF
are excluded from the \code{GCAE} analysis.
\code{maf} must be a value between zero and 0.5
(i.e. excluding zero and excluding 0.5).
By default, \code{maf} is set to the lowest
representable non-zero floating-point value,}

\item{map_table}{a genetic mapping table.

A \code{map_table} is a \link[tibble]{tibble} with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{CHR}: the chromosome code or contig name.
The chromosome number cannot exceed 95
(\url{https://www.cog-genomics.org/gcae/1.9/input#chr_set})
\item \code{SNP}: Variant identifier
\item \code{position_cm}: Position in morgans or centimorgans.
This value is optional. Zeroes denote it is unused
\item \code{BP}: Base-pair coordinat
}}

\item{os}{name of the operating system,
as returned by \link[rappdirs]{app_dir}}

\item{out}{the base filename of the output files.
This parameter is named after the \code{GCAE}
\code{--out} flag}

\item{ped_table}{a 'pedigree' table.

A \code{ped_table} is a \link[tibble]{tibble} with these columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{FID} The family ID
\item \code{IID} Within-family ID (cannot be zero)
\item \code{within_family_id_father} Within-family ID of father
(\code{0} if father isn't in dataset)
\item \code{within_family_id_mother} Within-family ID of mother
(\code{0} if mother isn't in dataset)
\item \code{sex_code} Sex code
(\code{1} = male, \code{2} = female, \code{0} = unknown)
\item \code{case_control_code} Case control code
(\code{1} = control, \code{2} = case,
\code{9}/\code{0}/non-numeric = missing data if case/control)
\item \code{snv_[x][y]} Nucleotide for the \code{x}th variant
for haplotype \code{y} (\code{y} is either \code{a} or \code{b})
in the \code{.map file} (\code{0} = no call)
}

The \code{FID} and \code{IID} column names match the GCAE names, see
\url{https://www.cog-genomics.org/gcae/1.9/input#pheno}.}

\item{phe_filename}{name of a raw phenotype file.
Use \link{read_gcae_phe_file} to read a raw phenotype file.}

\item{phenotype_increase}{the phenotypic value increase per rare allele,
for an additive trait.}

\item{phe_table}{a table of phenotypes.

A \code{phe_table} is a \link[tibble]{tibble} with these columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{FID} The family ID
\item \code{IID} Within-family ID
(cannot be zero)
\item One or more columns of phenotype values,
columns can have any name
}

Thes names match the GCAE column
names (\url{https://www.cog-genomics.org/gcae/1.9/input#pheno}).
Use \link{read_gcae_phe_file} to read a phenotype file.
Use \link{check_phe_table} to test if a phenotype table is valid.}

\item{gcae_exe_path}{path to
the \code{GCAE} or \code{GCAE2} executable file.}

\item{gcae_folder}{folder where \code{GCAE} is installed}

\item{gcae_version}{version of GCAE, e.g. \code{"1.0"}
Use \link{get_gcae_version} to get the \code{GCAE} version.}

\item{gcaer_folder}{name of the folder where \link{gcaer}
stores its temporary files}

\item{trait}{one trait with a clear genetic architecture and a known
minor allele frequency, as created by \link{create_trait}.
Use \link{is_one_trait} to detect if something is one trait}

\item{traits}{one or more traits
with a clear genetic architecture and a known minor allele frequency,
as, for example, created by \link{create_demo_traits}.}

\item{url}{\code{GCAE} download URL}

\item{verbose}{the verbosity of a function.
Set to \link{TRUE} for more output.
Use \link{check_verbose} to detect if this argument is valid.}

\item{phenotype}{one phenotype, named after its genetic background:
\itemize{
\item \code{random} the phenotype is a random value,
i.e. there is no association between the genetics and
this phenotype
\item \code{additive} the phenotype is perfectly additive
(the nucleotides used are A and T as these are in the word 'additive'):
\itemize{
\item \code{AA} 11.0
\item \code{AT} 10.5
\item \code{TT} 10.0
}
}}

\item{gcae_options}{options to run GCAE,
as created by \link{create_gcae_options}}
}
\description{
This function does nothing. It is intended to inherit is parameters'
documentation.
}
\note{
This is an internal function, so it should be marked with
\code{@noRd}. This is not done, as this will disallow all
functions to find the documentation parameters
