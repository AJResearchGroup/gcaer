\arguments{
\item{datadir}{directory where sample data is stored.
If not absolute: assumed relative to \verb{GenoCAE/} directory.
A valid \code{datadir} ends with a slash (\code{/})
and does not start with a full stop (\code{.})}

\item{data}{file prefix, not including path, of the data files.
The data files must be in EIGENSTRAT
or PLINK binary (\code{.bed}, \code{.bim}, \code{.fam}) format)}

\item{gcae_setup}{GCAE model setup,
as created by \link{create_gcae_setup}}

\item{superpops}{path to the superpops file.
This argument is named after the GCAE \code{--superpops} CLI flag.}

\item{gcae_options}{options to run GCAE,
as created by \link{create_gcae_options}}

\item{verbose}{the verbosity of a function.
Set to \link{TRUE} for more output.
Use \link{check_verbose} to detect if this argument is valid.}
}
\value{
full paths to the created files. These are:
\itemize{
\item \code{losses_from_project.csv} and \code{losses_from_project.pdf}
show the loss function value of the model per epoch.
Note that this is the loss for the entire data set.
\item \code{genotype_concordances.csv} and \code{genotype_concordances.pdf}
the genotype concordances of the model per epoch
(this is the rate that the model output is equal to the model input).
the black line shows the baseline genotype concordance,
given by guessing the most frequently occurring genotype per marker.
\item A file called \code{encoded_data.h5} containing the projected data
(= the encoded data) for all samples at each epoch.
This file is used by the plot, evaluate and animate commands.
\item for each saved epoch: a plot of the projected samples colored
according to population, and if specified, superpopulation.
A legend is written to a separate file.
\item A plot \code{true_genotypes.pdf} showing a histogram of the true (input)
genotypes that the model is trained on
\item A plot output_as_genotypes.pdf showing a histogram of the model output
interpreted as genotypes, for the last epoch
